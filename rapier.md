## Rules

Rapier fighting in Atlantia is governed by an ordered hierarchy of rules.

1. Kingdom Rapier Rules, defined in [Section 3.12 of the Kingdom Earl Marshal’s Policy](/paperwork/).  These rules define Atlantia's specific rapier conventions and take precedence over all other rules.
2. Kingdom Marshal Rules, defined in [Section 3 of the Kingdom Earl Marshal’s Policy](/paperwork/), excluding the components specific to other forms of combat.  These rules define Atlantia's overall marshal conventions.
3. Society Rapier Rules, defined in the [SCA's Fencing Marshal's Handbook](https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fencing-Marshals-Handbook_Jan2024.pdf).  These rules define the SCA's rapier conventions.
4. Society Marshal's rules, defined in the [SCA's Marshal's Handbook](https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MarshalHandbookforRattanCombat.pdf), excluding the components specific to other forms of combat.  These rules define the Society's overall marshal conventions.

In some melee combat scenarios, combat archery may be employed.  Combat Archery rules are defined in [Section 3.12.5](https://marshal.atlantia.sca.org/paperwork/) of the Atlantian Book of Policy.

At events, all equipment or clothing used by participants on the list field must either have a pre-17th Century appearance or be covered in a manner to present such an appearance per [Section 3.4](/paperwork/) of the Atlantian Book of Policy.  For implementation, please see the [Guidance regarding Blatantly Modern Items on the List Field](/procedures/modern/).

For youth rapier fighters, additional rules apply as defined in [Section 3.9 of Kingdom Earl Marshal’s Policy](/paperwork/) and the [Society Youth Marshal Handbook](https://www.sca.org/officers/marshal/youthcombat/docs/YouthMartialHandbook.pdf).
