* Practice reports not required unless there’s an incident  
* No quarterly reporting requirement to this office; that’s a waiver reporting requirement  
* Reports are very important and useful. Pictures add a lot

**Experiments**

* None active at this time

**General Comments 2025**

* 101 Class split, “Basic” is a 2 hour session for MIT. “Update” is the refresher.   
* Limited Marshals authorized to teach; KEM, TRNG, Rapier Deputies, Geoffrey C, Percy, Llwyd  
* Rules rewrite still actively being worked at the Society level – Draft posted, typos, please cc me on comments.   
* Calibration \- reports still indicate a generally upward trend; stop that\!  
  * Long Sword and Spear the disproportionate culprit  
  * Practice with Long Sword and Spear in a melee format  
  * HEMA armor and Chainmail, practice calling blows  
* Talk in 6 months?  
  * Pennsic Prep

# **Philosophy** 

* Fencing in the SCA is a privilege earned by demonstrating you can fight safely and will comply with our policies.   
* This is a sport and people will likely get injured, so there is risk.   
* Ideally the injuries will be minor, such as bruises, and the frequency low.   
* Accidents will happen, so we want to do what we can to ensure compliance with SCA policy which is intended to reduce the chance someone will be seriously injured.   
* Anyone intentionally not complying with our rules is selfish and putting others at risk.   
* There is no such thing as an “Unofficial” practice  
* We are a team and should communicate up and down the chain   
* We should fix problems and not exclude people

# **Duties of a Local Rapier Marshal** 

* Ensure compliance with rules and policy\* at all practices and events to promote our fencers safety and Rapier as an activity.   
  * Inspect equipment; yearly safety stand down.   
  * Oversee conduct of fighters  
  * Handle and report adverse incidents  
* Run local Practice  
* Marshal during tournaments and Melees (Covered in detail in the 201 class)  
* Conduct  Authorizations  
* Participate in the MIT program


**Armor Inspections and Standards \- Torso Chainmail** 

* Chain mail shirts are legal. Verify there are no missing rings in vital areas. If you can’t see it because the fighter is wearing a shirt, politely ask them if they have inspected the shirt that day and if it is in good order. We are issuing a policy clarification to state:   
  * Appendix 2 of the Society Rapier Handbook states that: *'When inspecting a combatant’s armor, you may not be able to see every part of armor.  In these cases, ask the combatant about their armor and to determine if they know the rules and are, per their assertion, armored accordingly.'*  This may be the case, for example, when someone is wearing chainmail underneath other clothing; it is sufficient to ask them if they appropriately inspected their chainmail before donning it."   
* Based on feedback from fencers the most likely failure point is the underarms due to pulls from movement.  Add a gusset?  
* Lord Fujina is a great resource for how to repair the shirts.   
* Blow calling can be difficult as the shirt may be draping away from the body  
* Be sure to check the gorget/shirt coverage for gaps. A hood made of penetration resistant material is allowed providing it covers the area . 

# **Armor Inspections and Standards – Limbs (section 9.2 page 18 of the Fencing Marshals Handbook)** 

Hand and Arms

* For Heavy Rapier there is no longer a requirement to wear gloves or abrasion resistant material on the arms or legs. However in my opinion it is a good idea.  
* For Light Rapier and C\&T there is still a requirement for coverage by abrasion resistant material on the arms.   
* For cut and thrust, verify at least soft elbows and appropriate hand protection for the weapons forms are being worn.

 Legs

* There is no requirement to cover the leg in Heavy rapier, but they must be covered by abrasion resistant material in C\&T and light rapier.  
* There is no requirement to wear shoes in heavy rapier but combatants should be encouraged to do so and we are working a formal rule change to make them required. 

#  **Armor Inspections and Standards \- Overall appearance (10’ rule)**

* The fencer’s kit shall look SCA period at a distance of 10’ or greater.  
* The intention is to improve the appearance of the field, not prevent people from playing.   
* In general, this means no obvious sports logos, fluorescent colors, etc. Sports armor should be completely covered.  
* Be especially polite and helpful in the enforcement of this rule, but firm. This also applies to authorizing fencers. This is something that should be first addressed at the local practice level.  
* If an authorizing fencer does not meet this standard find out who is running their practice and talk to that marshal.  
* If an experienced fencer does not meet this standard they may be removed from the field.   
* To the extent possible reduce the clutter of obviously modern equipment around the list area.   
* We will be issuing a separate clarification on this. 

# **Weapons Inspections and Standards \- Blades** 

* Check blades for; kinks, S curves, sharp bends, cracks, rust, or burrs.  
* Flex the blade by executing a thrust against the ground or other rigid object to see if there are any localized bends.   
* Verify tips:  
  * Will not be dislodged easily.  
  * Contrasting color tape is used.  
  * NO tape covers the end of the tip.  
  * Has adequate protection against punch-through (e.g., metal in the tip) except for spatulated tips.  
  * No electric tape   
* If the flex of a blade is questioned, be prepared to test it to Society standards.  
* Hilts and defensive gear such as Bucklers should not have any sharp points or edges nor be designed to capture blades.   
* There is discussion about the use of Electric tape but it is not finalized at this time. 

# **Rubber Band Guns** 

* The Marshalling of Rubber Band Guns is now under the purview of Rapier Marshals  
* You will conduct inspections and Marshal their use. You will need a way to measure the draw force required for the ammunition.   
* Using RBGs does not require authorization, but the weapons and ammunition must be inspected.  
* RBGs must look like a period muzzle-loading weapon dated before 1600 CE.   
* RBGs must be made from sturdy, yet lightweight materials that can withstand regular combat. All edges and corners must be smoothed off, and no splinters or cracks must exist. Same as a rigid parrying device.   
* RBGs or similar apparatus that fire flexible projectiles using the elasticity of the projectiles as the sole propulsion force may not have a draw strength of greater than 30 lbs (13.6 kg) per projectile.   
* If RBG are used the rules for missile weapons apply including eye protection and a stand off area around the fighting area. 

# **Practice \- Melees** 

* Unauthorized Fencers are allowed to practice melees at practices under controlled conditions  
  * A Marshal will supervise  
  * Everyone will know who is not authorized  
  * The practice will have a training goal that everyone is clear on  
  * Fencers who will not moderate their actions to comply with the goals will not be allowed.  
  * The intent is to prepare the new fencer for the complexity of melees by introducing concepts in increasing complexity as they are able to absorb them. For example start with static line work to introduce cross shots. Next discuss the use of terrain. Finally allow maneuver.   
* Generally the hardest hits we are seeing are from spears and long swords in melee.  
  * People need to practice with these weapons in melees circumstances with a goal of controlling force under different conditions.   
  * Fencers should be doing pell and point control work with spears and long swords with stressing oblique and other out of center shots to learn measure and control. 

# **Fighter Improvement Program** 

* The Fighter Improvement Program is an effort to correct problems a fencer has repeatedly demonstrated before they get sanctioned.   
* Our Goal as Marshals is to ensure Fencers fight safely and do not generate a negative environment that adversely effects others. The vast majority of fighters share this goal but some need additional guidance to achieve it.    
* Generally the problem areas are Blow calling, Excessive force, or a Disrespectful Attitude.   
* Once a Fighter has been indentified as needing more attention the issue will be discussed with them and documented in a report. Ideally this will be a onetime occurrence.   
* If the issue persists than the KRM in consultation with the KEM and in conjunction with a local Marshal may put the fighter on an Improvement Program.   
* This program notifies the fencers of specific issues, such as blow calling or behavior, which the fencer needs to correct or they may face formal action such as being sanctioned or having their authorization revoked.   
* A critical aspect of this program is that personnel, such as the local Marshal or a local senior fencer, should be identified to help the Fencer correct their issue.    
* The primary goal is to fix the issue and improve the fencer not loose them.  
* This program does not restrict the Fencers activities within Atlantian fencing, though the reason for the Fencers involvement in the program may be a factor in restricting their activities. 

# **Event Reporting** 

* Reports from events and practices are essential for our success in Marshalling.  
* Required after event, but can be written at any time by anyone about official Fencing activities  
* Generally describes the activities of the event; authorizations, tournaments, participation.   
* Must Indicate any adverse issues:   
  * Injuries, Broken equipment, Behavioral  
  * Details are critical, people involved, circumstances, indicate statements vs analysis.   
  * Pictures are excellent  
* Can be used to share or document suggestions  
  * Reports can be searched.   
    * Adverse incidents should be tagged  
    * Supports Fighter Improvement Program and Sanctions  
    * Data project, looking at trends  
* \*\* Video taping fights is a very useful tool. We are looking at having systems for Marshals at events such as Pennsic.   
* At the February University we will be doing a session looking at ideas for how to run an effective practice. More info to come on that.
