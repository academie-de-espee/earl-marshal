# Summary
Atlantia is now participating in the Society [Reduced Armor experiment](https://rapier.eastkingdom.org/reduced-armor-experiment/) as of TBD.  As a reminder, this experiment is NOT valid for light rapier, which means not for most youth rapier either.

# Rules
Atlantia will be using the [rules](https://rapier.eastkingdom.org/reduced-armor-experiment/) as written from the East Kingdom.  The KRM reserves the right to further limit those rules in the future.

# Participation
To be eligible to participate in the experiment, you must fill out [Atlantia's Interest Form]() and be approved by the Atlantia KRM or one of their deputies.  Do **NOT** start your reduced armor participation until you receive approval.  Participation in the experiment is entirely voluntary.

# Reporting Requirements
If you are participating in the experiment, you are required to use the [Unified Reporting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NUXdo4_kOEWegeNjkSqeP146DhKlngSbdH7SZtzijPk) to submit a report after *every practice or event* you use reduced armor at.  In addition, please submit reports through the Atlantia [Warrant site](https://warrant.atlantia.sca.org) under the **Marshal Experiements** dropdown.  As part of the purpose of this experiment is to reduce heat injuries, it is especially important to make sure such types of injuries are included in our normal reports as well.
