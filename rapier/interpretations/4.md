Marshals,

I do not want you conducting the office of an MoL while you are acting as a marshal at an event. Pick one and do it.

The job of the marshal is to be an impartial witness and to insure that the fighting is safe and that the rules are being followed. Attempting to do this while also maintain the list tree/cards/etc. means that you will most likely be falling down on one or both of these positions.

Now if itâ€™s a speed tourney, a bear pit, a ToC or another format where no tallies are being kept, it is acceptable for a marshal to deal with it (but work this out with the MoL beforehand.) Otherwise leave the office of the MoL to the MoL.

I need you to be doing your job, not the job of another office.

Otto

Earl Marshal.
