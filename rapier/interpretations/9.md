Another reminder of engagement in rapier melees:

A few months ago, I sent out a missive discussing engagement in rapier melees. Given recent discussion, I am sending out another one. As a refresher, let me remind everyone that we follow an ordered hierarchy of rules, with the order specified here:

https://marshal.atlantia.sca.org/rapier/

What does this mean? If the first set of rules does not specifically discuss something, we must then check the next set of rules, and so on. As an example, the rapier and society rapier rules do not discuss holds. Holds are defined in the kingdom marshal rules and society marshal rules.

Kingdom policy 3.1.3.1.2.1 states the DEM must define the rules of engagement specific to the discipline. As the kingdom rules do not specifically address engagement at this time, it is needful to follow the society and kingdom armored rules, with society rapier rules trumping areas within the kingdom armored rules that conflict.

In this case, kingdom melee policy 3.6.1.13.1 states "No more than four fighters shall attack a single opponent." As this is not conflicted in society rapier rules, rapier fighters in Atlantia must follow this policy.

Thanks,

Master Brian de Moray, KRM
