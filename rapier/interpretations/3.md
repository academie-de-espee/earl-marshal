Subject: [Marshalls] rapier marshal policy reminder
```

his is a reminder of current policy: As of April of 2016, Master Giacomo changed Atlantia's rapier marshal structure, unifying to only a single class of rapier marshal.

If you are a warranted rapier marshal, you may oversee any rapier activities of which you are authorized. This aligns rapier marshal warrants with Atlantia's armored marshal warrants.

This means if you are a rapier marshal and authorized in only heavy rapier, you may only oversee heavy rapier activities. This includes marshalling fighting and authorizations.

If you are a rapier marshal and authorized in Cut & Thrust, you may oversee Cut & Thrust activities. This includes marshalling fighting and authorizations.

There is *NO* difference between those able to marshal C&T via the previous and current process.

Thanks,

Master Brian de Moray

Senior Special Deputy to the Kingdom Earl Marshal
