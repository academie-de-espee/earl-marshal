Subject: [Marshalls] Change in Marshallate
```

It is my intention to change business operations to the following:

-  If you are a Warranted Marshal

- and you are warranted in cut and thrust

- Then you are warranted to conduct cut and thrust activities

My specific intention is to normalize how are marshallate aligns with the other styles.

Marshals are strictly reminded that while our rules are at best problematic at this time, strict adherence to all requirements are necessary.  Please remember that Cut and Thrust is just another portion of the rapier game.

Please consider this effective today.

Giacomo
