Subject: [Marshalls] Realignment of training regions for the marshal's office.

I would like to take this time to announce a change in the Marshal’s training regions for Atlantia.

The new regions will be:

North:                   All of Maryland

North-Central:  All of Virginia

South Central:   All of North Carolina

South:                   All of South Carolina plus Border Vale Keep

This will align the training regions for the Marshal’s office with the regions for the Seneschal’s office, and will hopefully ease the burden on those in the far south to meet their out of region requirements.

Some of my discipline deputies currently have deputies for regionals that do not match this structure. This change will not affect the administration of their discipline beyond the affects it has on the training of new marshals. They will continue to appoint regional deputies as needed to administer their office.

 
Yours in Service,

Otto von Schwartzkatz,

Earl Marshal
