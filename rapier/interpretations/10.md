Subject: clarification on dying defensively in rapier
```

All,

If a fighter is unable to continue fighting, they should grasp their weapons by the blade near the hilt with the tip pointed directly at the ground, and walk off the field without disrupting the flow of battle.  If the fighter is unable to safely remove themselves from the field of combat, the fighter should kneel while holding their weapons as previously described until they are able to remove themselves from the field.

Do not implement or instruct fighters to "die defensively" when fighting rapier by laying on the ground in any fashion.

Master Brian de Moray

Kingdom Rapier Marshal
