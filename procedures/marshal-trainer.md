Teaching potential marshals how to be a marshal is an important task for the future of combat within the SCA.  In Atlantia, you need to have a special warrant any classes you teach to count towards the manditory continuing education requirements of any warrant.
This is a guide for how to do that:

1. Become an SCA member.  All marshals must maintain an active SCA membership.
2. Become a warranted marshal in the discipline in question for a number of years.
3. Ask for concurrence for you to teach the classes from the disipline specific Deputy Kingdom Earl Marshal.
4. Take a "Train-the-Instructor" class from the Deputy Kingdom Earl Marshal for Training.
5. If the DEM-Training and the DEM-dispiline-deputy agree, you will notified as to your status to teach the classes.

Be sure to always use the latest class paperwork from the kingdom marshal website and submit a roster of all attendees each time you teach one of the classes.
